Nosefart plays NSF (Nintendo Entertainment System Sound Format) files so you
can listen to those old tunes without actually having to play through the
games.

This is a creaky old program, mostly unmaintained for years and years.  Still,
perhaps you will find it useful.

Nosefart runs in a variety of environments:

## Standalone player in Linux: command-line

The primary target.

Nosefart does not play nicely with the way some Linux systems handle
sound in the modern age. It might not work if, for instance, esd is running. In
this case, you must kill esd (breaking all your normal sound programs for
the session) for it to work.

If you use pulseaudio, use the wrapper program padsp to run nosefart.

If you know how to make nosefart always work without wrappers, please submit
a pull request with the solution.

## Standalone player in Linux: graphical

A front-end to the command line program, with all the fragility that entails.
Works, though.

## Standalone player in MS-DOS

Unmaintained. You can get this by unzipping the MS-DOS package. It can also be
found in the source package.

## XMMS plugin

## Winamp plugin

Works in Winamp 2.x and 5.x thanks to K`rai. Download it and copy the DLL into
your Winamp plugins directory. It's also in the source package.

## CL-amp plugin

Contributed and possibly maintained by Eli Dayan. You can install it from the
CL-amp package. It can also be found on Eli's page or in the source package.

## Other

I've heard that nosefart is embedded in PocketPSP for Windows CE. Scary.

Likewise, I'm told that it's somewhere inside The Xbox Media Center.
